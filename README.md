# Snake

A simple text-based version of the classic game Snake.

### Rules
Control the snake with the arrow keys and guide it towards the fruit!

**Bananas** will increase the length of your snake by **one**, **cherries** will increase the length of your snake by **four** and **grapefruits** will increase the length of your snake by **nine**. Once you reach a length of **100**, you win! Don't collide with yourself, however, otherwise you'll get stuck and the game will end.

### Note
It is written in BBC BASIC (BB4W), so the code might not render properly on a GitHub/web browser. If this is the case, the code can be viewed in the BB4W IDE, which can be downloaded here: http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcwin/download.html. This should display the code properly.
